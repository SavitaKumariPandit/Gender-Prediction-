                                   Gender Predicton from textual data using NLP and Machine Learning model.

I build a machine learning model to predict gender based on textual data. There are many available repositories on GitHub that using image data, feature data, predefined male-female name data to predict gender. but if these types of data are not available in this scenario it is impossible to predict gender. My proposed approach is to predict gender from any type of English textual sentence. It helps in many real-life situations like

To predict gender from any English sentence which can be useful for the investigation department to detect sentence or words written by male or female
2)To monitor gender traffic on a live webpage which is useful for website owners in terms of monetary.
